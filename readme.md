Direction of traversal of rectangles by people as a function of sight lines
=======

## Introduction

For a while, I've been thinking that a shorter person is more likely to start
with the short leg when traversing a rectangle. After a further ponder, I
think relates to whether they can see their final location; somatic education
methods like Alexander Technique claim that vision is important in guiding
movement. This leads me to a slightly different hypothesis:

> Given two paths of equal distance to a goal, a person is more likely to
> choose the path where the goal is visible sooner.

In the case of the rectangle, this would mean that people would start
with the short leg if they can't see the target, as getting to the long
leg would help them see the target. It might also mean that they would
start with the long leg if they can see the target because starting with
the short leg would make them turn further away from the target at first,
making it harder to see.

Depending on how rectangular paths are designed, this potential relationship
could be confounded with effects of handedness; theories like right-hand
preference suggest that, other things being equal, people might be more likely
to start with the right side (more specifically, the side of their handedness).

## Methods

Participants were made to chose how to traverse a rectangular table in order
to retrieve beers from the opposite corner. The table arrangement and beer
location were varied, and route of travel was recorded.

### Room setup

A long table was placed in the middle of the room. Two beers were placed at one
corner, and an "X" was drawn on the floor at the opposite corner.

### Participants

Participants were recruited at a [frat party, picnic, &c.] in [place]; they were
offered a beer in return for participation in a one-minute experiment.
[Demographics--general age, location, &c.].

### Procedure

Participants were asked to stand at the X and were given the following directions.

1. Do not start walking until I say "start".
2. There are two beers at the opposite corner of the table.
3. When I tell you, walk to the opposite corner of the table, and pick up the beers.
4. After you pick them up, bring them back here, and put either one on this "X".
5. You may keep the other beer.

After giving these directions, the experimentor asked "Do these directions make
sense?" and clarified any resulting misunderstandings. Once the directions were
clear, the experimentor told the participants, "Please start."

As the participant traversed the table, the experimentor drew two arrows on a
form (figure [form]) to indicate whether the participant turned left or right
at the start of each of the two legs of the trip (from the "X" to the beers
and from the beers to the "X").

After the participant returned the beer, the experimentor asked for the
participants handedness and then debriefed the participant.

### Variables

#### Interventions
Before the participant entered the experiment room, it was configured into
one of four ways based on two two-level factors:

1. target location and
2. short leg.

Target location was one of "floor" or "table". Beers were placed on the floor
in the floor condition and on the table in the table condition.

They also had a specific placement in the horizontal axes. In both conditions,
the beers were placed within [four inches] of the corner point. In the table
condition, the beers were placed approximately along the diagonal of the
rectangular table that included the corner point. In the floor condition, the
beers were placed [four inches] from the corner in the opposite direction,
so they were not underneath the table.

Given the table dimensions and the beer placement, participants should have
been able to see the beers in the floor condition when they were at either
of the adjacent corners but not when they were at the opposite corner. In the
table condition, participants should have been able to see the beers from any
corner.

#### Demographics
Participants were asked for their handedness, which was recorded as "left",
"right" or "other". Data from participants with "other" handedness were
ignored.
