Direction of traversal of rectangles by people as a function of sight lines
=======

## Introduction

For a while, I've been thinking that a shorter person is more likely to start
with the short leg when traversing a rectangle. After a further ponder, I
think relates to whether they can see their final location; somatic education
methods like Alexander Technique claim that vision is important in guiding
movement. This leads me to a slightly different hypothesis:

> Given two paths of equal distance to a goal, a person is more likely to
> choose the path where the goal is visible sooner.

In the case of the rectangle, this would mean that people would start
with the short leg if they can't see the target, as getting to the long
leg would help them see the target. It might also mean that they would
start with the long leg if they can see the target because starting with
the short leg would make them turn further away from the target at first,
making it harder to see.

Depending on how rectangular paths are designed, this potential relationship
could be confounded with effects of handedness; theories like right-hand
preference suggest that, other things being equal, people might be more likely
to start with the right side (more specifically, the side of their handedness).
