Direction of traversal of rectangles by people as a function of sight lines
=======

For a while, I've been thinking that a shorter person is more likely to start
with the short leg when traversing a rectangle. After a further ponder, I
think relates to whether they can see their final location; somatic education
methods like Alexander Technique claim that vision is important in guiding
movement.
